The goal of this project is to analyze reviews on Yelp from NYC boba shops and find relationships between words and star ratings using NLP techniques.
I gathered the data of yelp reviews by webscraping the site using selenium, performed text preprocessing steps, and text analysis, such as sentiment analysis,
n-grams, and topic modeling.
