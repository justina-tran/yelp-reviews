        find relationships between words and star ratings using NLP techniques. I gathered data from \
        webscraping reviews on Yelp from 50 boba stores in NYC. I performed EDA, text preprocessing steps, \
        and text analysis, including sentiment analysis, n-grams, and topic modeling. I also experimented \
        with building a classification model to predict the star rating of a review.
